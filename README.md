# Acoustic Simulation in JavaScript

This repository contains a web page for acoustic simulation which was created as part of a semester paper.
It uses [ResonanceAudio](https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/) for spacializing audio.
The [room models](https://cdn.rawgit.com/resonance-audio/resonance-audio-web-sdk/master/examples/room-models.html) demo included in the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/resonance-audio/resonance-audio-unity-sdk) was modified to fit the needs of the paper.
Their original SDK and source are licends under the `Apache License 2.0`, therefore this project is licensed under it aswell.
